**Project Overview**
The Sleep Gender Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the gender of individuals based on sleep efficiency and related data. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing techniques, and multiple machine learning models, the project highlights how data science can reveal meaningful patterns in health-related datasets.

**Key Features**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed to uncover patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the dataset.
Includes visualization of key metrics to enhance understanding.

Data Preprocessing:
